## Question 1:
Write a program to replace all taboo words, saved in taboo file, in all .txt files in the current directory with the corresponding number of ‘*’, e.g. if there are 2 words in taboo: ‘bad’ and ‘worse’, then any word ‘bad’ and ‘worse’ in a txt file will be replaced by ‘***’ and ‘*****’, and your program output the number of such replacements after processing each file, if there are more than 5 taboo words in a file, the file is moved to the ‘trash’ folder.
## Question 2:
   For an integer array A of n+1 numbers that are already sorted in ascending order, one unknown number is repeated and put next to it, e.g., for n=5, A is [1,2,2,3,4,5], 2 is repeated. Write an efficient program of time complexity O(log n) to find out which number is repeated.

## Question 3:
   Given a 2-D square matrix A[n,n] and it is known that the values along each row and each column are sorted in ascending order. Write an efficient program to search for the location of query value q in A: if q is in A, then return the position (i, j); otherwise returns -1.
